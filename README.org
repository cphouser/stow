* setup notes
** dependencies?
things i'll always need that we can get from apt

emacs is 27.1 as of bullseye (doom is happy)
none of these were on the debian server install but might be there otherwise in standard install config
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt install vim git emacs stow
#+END_SRC

*** add user to sudoers
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# as root add below to /etc/sudoers
username ALL=(ALL) ALL
# edit the file w/ below (checks syntax before write)
visudo
#+END_SRC


*** add nonfree repositories
just add =non-free= to each line. add =contrib= too if it isn't present.
should all end in =main contrib non-free=


*** get an ssh key for github

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "cphouser@gmail.com"
eval `ssh-agent -s`
#+END_SRC

add =~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub= to [[https://github.com/settings/keys]]


*** emacs
copies from doom-emacs install instructions:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+END_SRC


** install order
*** bash
really should go first
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# make these folders first so they aren't just symlinks
mkdir ~/.local; mkdir ~/.local/bin; rm ~/.bashrc ~/.profile
cd ~/stow; stow bash; exec bash
#+END_SRC

**** addendums
adds aliases for connecting to the Fetch VPN w/ nmcli
check out the wiki page for how to set that up


*** emacs
early to view this document nicely
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
rm -r ~/.doom.d
stow emacs
ln -s "$HOME/.emacs.d/bin/doom" "$HOME/.local/bin/doom"
doom sync
#+END_SRC

*** =stow vim=

*** =stow xterm=

*** i3
detail this later - important to come after xterm since we source the colorscheme file from it
